FreeIPA Server in a docker container

my freeipa server config. 
  - uses another repo (submodule) to build a docker container docker-freeipa


TODO
  - deluser script
  - other user scripts

NOTE: currently contains 2 submodules to assist in maintaining 
      the repo. The gitconfig is not required, but simlifies the
      git config 

So essentially this is for informational purposes â€” But could be used to 
run a freeIPA server
